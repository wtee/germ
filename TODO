I'm not planning on adding any major new features (aside from 
allowing for plugins) before making it to stable release.
I think it's functional enough as is.

That said, below is a list of things that may (or just 
as likely may not) go into the next developmental version.

To Do:
Give code a good thorough auditing to make sure it is stable 
enough for a stable release.

Add plugin support to allow for extending germ's functionality
without burdening the main core with excessive features.

(Not Likely) To Do:
Text::Wrap all input so that posts with overly long lines 
don't run off the edge of old browsers (and because long 
lines get annoying to read).

Make tag tracking/searching more efficient.  

Allow for the creation of a static phlog.

Add full-text search functionality.
