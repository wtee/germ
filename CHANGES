Changes:

germ-0.4.0 (it's about time release)

At long last, germ has become multi-plaform. With the
addition of a few lines of code and some refinements
germ should now work with any gopher server that passes
arguments directly to cgi scripts (a la Bucktooth) AND
any server that uses traditional CGI environmental variables,
specifically QUERY_STRING,to communicate with scripts 
(a la Gophernicus and Motsognir). It still not likely
to work with any server that doesn't communicate with
its scripts through one of the above methods.

what's changed:
-germ can recognize and use QUERY_STRING for servers
 that provide it. It defaults to @ARGV otherwise.
-comment limit is now 950 characters.

what's been fixed:
-tag search spat out some protests about uninitialized
 variables. Now it doesn't.
-vistors can no longer comment on non-existent posts.
-comment text and leave a comment text now wrap at 65
 columns, which should actually work for 80 column displays.
 In the context of a gopher menu, 70 column lines were often
 still too long.
-minor security improvements.

germ-0.3.1 (quick fix release)

what's been fixed:
-comment text and leave a comment text now wrap at 70 columns.  
-dates are now printed with each comment.  Version 0.3 broke this.

germ-0.3 (Back to school release)

I've incorporated many of the features and a good portion of code from 
slugmax@sdf.org's version of germ (germ 0.2), so in deference this release is 
germ 0.3.

what's been added:
-ability to include links within gopherlog posts (in 0.2)
-ability to shorten posts (in 0.2)
-ability to include tags, with spaces if so desired (in 0.2, partially)
-a comment counter

what's been fixed:
-put Configurable Variables in a more logical order, with the one variable
 that must be changed at the top, followed by customization variables,
 then more technical variables (that SDF users don't need to change) 
 toward the bottom of the list.
-added comments 
-cut out a lot of excess lines of code.  With all the added features and 
 comments germ-0.3 is only 22 lines longer than germ 0.1.
 
 what's been broken:
 -I chose, for this release at least, not to implement germ 0.2's ability to
  change the post extension.  
 
 The new features are documented in the file USAGE, portions of which were
 also authored by slugmax@sdf.org, the example post (again partially authored
 by slugmax@sdf.org) has been altered to demonstrate germ's new features.
