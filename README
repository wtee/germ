germ-0.3 alpha release
(c) 2009-2011, Wesley Teal, wt@sdf.lonestar.org

"Let your ideas germinate."

    germ
    n 1: anything that provides inspiration for later work 
    [syn: {source}, {seed}, {germ}]
    2: a small apparently simple structure (as a fertilized egg)
    from which new tissue can develop into a complete organism
    3: a dynamic gopherlog script meant to combine useful features
    with ease of use and small codebase 

Germ (as in the germ of a seed or an idea) is a dynamic glogging/phlogging 
script written in perl.  It has the capability to display posts individually 
and together on a page with a customizable header and a customizable divider 
between posts.  It also archives older posts and can accept comments on 
individual posts.  Germ owes its inspiration to the perl weblog engine 
"blosxom" originally authored by Rael Dornfest.

This is an beta release.  While germ seems to be fairly stable, it still needs 
testing and refinement.  Nothing is guarnteed to work and if it does, it's 
still not guarunteed to work properly.  If you find any bugs or want any 
particular features, please email me at the address listed above.

Germ has been tested and works with the Bucktooth gopher server (buckd) 
and with the Gophernicus gopher server, it seems to work fine with both.
It has not been currently tested with other servers, but should 
hypothetically work with any server that passes QUERY_STRING or ARGV to
their executable scripts.
