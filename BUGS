Bugs:

Due to the primative menu paging in the
UMN gopher client, long posts in germ will not
properly display. There's no obvious way to 
fix this that doesn't involve altering the client
itself or scattering frequent links throughout
longer posts.

A pound sign (#) in comments convert the three
characters that follow it into an octal number,
which is then interpreted as a character code.
